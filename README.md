# Spam-or-Not-Spam

Self Assessment (Umer Ayub)

In this project, I developed the EmailDataSet, SpamModel, Model, DataSet, and DataRow classes. I successfully implemented feature extraction to classify emails as spam or not spam, based on features like word count, bigrams, and the presence of the word "URL". The model uses logistic regression for prediction, where it outputs a probability that an email is spam, classifying it as spam if the probability exceeds 0.5. The accuracy of the model was evaluated based on test data, and the program worked well providing the results which we required. Key learning exemplars included implementing feature extraction, training the logistic regression model, managing data with DataSet and DataRow, and evaluating the modelâ€™s accuracy.

In this project, I aimed to develop a spam detection system.Data collection and preprocessing, Model training and evaluation, Integration of the model into a user-friendly application.
Managed and processed data using the `DataSet` and `DataRow` classes.
Assessed the model's accuracy and performance using test datasets.
